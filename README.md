# Snipers_Items
This mod itself is essentially empty but has all of my items as a dependency which means they will automatically download if you download this pack through a mod manager (recommended). 

Adds a few mainly vanilla-like items to Lethal Company. ([Discord link](https://discord.com/channels/1168655651455639582/1245084720614604873))
